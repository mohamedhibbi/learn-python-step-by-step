# learn-python-step-by-step


This repository is a collection of simple Python programs and examples aimed at beginners. 
It covers basic topics like:

- Printing to the console
- Arithmetic operations
- Operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, floor division)
- And more as I continue learning

Each example comes with clear explanations and comments, so anyone new to Python can follow along and understand the concepts. 

The goal of this repo is to document my Python learning journey while helping others get started with programming.
